## About Voyager

Voyager is a Node and SQL based web application framework that provides everything you need to produce robust, scalable, database-driven web apps, including:

* Built-in user authentication (opt-in)
* [Simplistic database migrations (Knex)](http://knexjs.org/)
* [Easy-to-use ORM (Sequelize)](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)
* [Clean, full-featured layout templating (Handlebars)](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
* [Robust front-end build system (Webpack)](https://webpack.js.org/)
* Modern ES6 syntax

Built on top of Express, and modeled after Rails and Laravel, Voyager provides a complete solution to getting up and running with a user-based app as quickly as possible.

## Getting Started

1. Download the [Voyager command line interface (CLI)](<(https://github.com/chriscourses/voyager-cli)>) with NPM:

        npm install -g voyager-cli

2. Create a new Voyager project, with or without auth:

        voyager new newApp

    or

        voyager new newApp --auth

3. Change directory to `newApp` and start the Voyager server:

        cd newApp
        voyager start

4. Open up a new terminal tab and run webpack:

        webpack

5. Your app should open up automatically at `http://localhost:3001` and you should see the Voyager start up page.
